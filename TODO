Missing algorithms:
-------------------
* A good conversion from letter or syllable representation to SLP representation, based on LZW compression and suffix trees (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree)

* SLPs with infinite number of generators. Currently "FreeGroup(IsSLPWordsFamily,infinity)" returns an unusable object.

* \^(g,h) which computes only once h

* SLPs for free monoids and semigroups
