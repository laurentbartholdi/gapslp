Free group elements are associative words. Currently, they can be
represented in letter and in syllable form; the syllable form is more
efficient if the word has large exponents.<P/>

This package adds a third representation for free group elements: as
straight line programs.

<Example><![CDATA[
gap> LoadPackage("gapslp");
gap> f := FreeGroup(2);
gap> x := SLPRepOfAssocWord(f.1);; y := SLPRepOfAssocWord(f.2);;
gap> (x*y)^1000;
(_1:=f1*f2;_1^1000)
]]></Example>

If a free group is created with the argument <C>IsSLPWordsFamily</C>,
then all generators of the free group are automatically created in SLP
representation.<P/>

All standard commands manipulating words (<C>SubWord</C>,
<C>Length</C>, etc.) are implemented for SLP words.
